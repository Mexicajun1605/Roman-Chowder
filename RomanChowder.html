<body> 
Roman Chowder is a family recipe of unknown origin. However, we know that the Cajun side of the Domingue family invented this recipe. It may have been invented around 1954. Today it is cooked and eaten by the Johnson family in Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, and possibly New Mexico. 
Roman Chowder is a hearty pasta dish that goes well with Cajun and Italian spices. 

Ingredients
<ol> 
<li> Small wavy egg noodles </li>
<li> 1 lb. Ground Beef </li>
<li> One can of Green Peas, 14 oz. </li>
<li> Shredded Cheddar Cheese, 8 oz.  </li> 
<li> 2 cans of peeled tomatoes </li>
<li> salt </li>
<li> Tabasco Hot Sauce </li>
<li> Tony's Cajun Seasoning </li>

<p>
Cook the ground beef and strain off the grease.
Put the cans of tomatoes (with juice) in skillet. If whole tomatoes chop them up.
Add juice (only juice) from english pea can to skillet.
Add about 8 ozs of egg noodles over the top of the tomatoes and juice.
Cover and boil until the juice is mostly gone. That cooks the egg noodles. Be careful, its easy to burn the bottom.
Add ground beef and stir.
Salt the mixture, I sprinkle it generously over the top.
Gently fold in the english peas.
Cover generously with cheddar cheese.
Broil on high in oven until the cheese begins to turn light brown. If you crack open the oven door it helps to evenly brown the cheese.

Remove from oven and let stand for two minutes.
